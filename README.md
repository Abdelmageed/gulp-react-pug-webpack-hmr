# Boilerplate For Projects With Gulp, React, Pug, Webpack, BrowserSync, and HMR

Quickly set up projects where you need React, and Webpack, and want to benefit
from Gulp automation, BrowserSync reloading, and Pug templates.

Tasks are managed in `gulp/tasks`.

Gulp builds assets to `dist/` which BrowserSync serves.

## Getting Started

```shell
$ npm install
```

## Getting Working

```shell
